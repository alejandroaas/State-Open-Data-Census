Working towards a US State Open Data Census

Would you like to help? Right now we're seeking information from people with subject-matter expertise in different state-level datasets. We're working to identify key datasets in the following categories:
* Companies
* Crime and Justice
* Earth observation, forestry, wildlife management, and agriculture
* Education
* Energy and Environment
* Finance and contracts
* Geospatial
* Economic Development
* Government Accountability and Democracy
* Health
* Science and Research
* Statistics
* Social mobility and welfare
* Transport and Infrastructure

If you've worked with a state-level dataset in any of those categories, please help us by providing more information about what are the most important specific datasets, and what attributes they should have, here: http://goo.gl/forms/aOa1Q8DWPd
